The objective of this CA exercise is to create a JavaFX application that can be supplied with an
autumnal image of a lawn, grass area, field, or similar showing fallen leaves on the ground. When
given the image, the application should automatically locate individual (and clusters of) leaves and
estimate how many of them are in the image overall
